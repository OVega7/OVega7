### Hello Everyone ðŸ‘‹

Oscar here. I recently graduated from the University of Houston-Downtown with a Bachelor of Science in Data Science with minors in Mathematics and Applied Statistics. My background includes working for oil and gas companies and most recently for a non-profit law firm which provides free legal representation to families with limited resources. I'm currently working on finding employment in the new field of data science. 

This page contains a few projects I've worked on during my studies and some personal projects.
